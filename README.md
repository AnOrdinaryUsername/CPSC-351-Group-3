## Getting Started

IDE preference is up to you. I recommend VSCode since there are some settings I already configured
in the `.vscode` folder.

I'm also assuming you're using Linux/MacOS for compiling.

### Visual Studio Code

 - Install [Clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)
